 * This class is a set of AppearanceGroup's.
 * In principle, AppearanceGroupSet's can exist autonomously, although
 * the "publish" methods of subordinate objects assume that the AppearanceGroupSet
 * is the child of a AppearanceAgent.  :TODO: adjusting the code so that
 * AppearanceGroupSet's can be entirely independent.
 * The AppearanceGroupSet has a lock for all modifications.  A small number of
 * methods are allowed to be "externally called" by threads that do not
 * already possess the lock.
 * The AppearanceGroupSet "externally callable" methods are responsible for
 * calling AppearanceGroup::publish() when new content is available for a
 * resource list.
