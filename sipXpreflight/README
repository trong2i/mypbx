INTRODUCTION
============
Preflight is a network test utility used to verify the functionality of various
network services which are required for proper operation of the sipXecs system.
It is capable of testing proper operation of the following network services:
  DHCP
  DNS
  NTP
  TFTP
  FTP
  HTTP

It can also perform basic testing of the sipXecs proxy, registrar and publisher.

For details on the operation of the command line version of preflight, invoke
with the "--help" switch.

NOTES: There used to be a windows installer but it was removed because it
was difficult to build and did not add a lot of value.
