There are probably some good tests here, but very difficult work with so they were not ported to autoconf --Douglas

To run the tests
================
Edit tester.properties and put your IP address there. See tester.properties.example

Make, install and configure sipx. 
You do not need to configure any trunks.  
Just run sipxecs-setup after make install.

Sipx should not be running when you run the regression tests. The tester will start/stop the services it needs.

From the BUILD/sipXbridge/regression directory run the Make target
'regression'.  This will execute the regression test cases.
