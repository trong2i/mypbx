The 'extras' directory is for sipX-related resources that are useful
enough to be kept under source control, but not tightly enough
integrated into the deliverable packages that there is a proper place
for them in the sipX* directories.  A "junk drawer" for sipX, if you
will.

Please add a brief description of items you enter in this directory:

interop-server-config
	Files for configuring sipX to be an interoperability testing
	server.

express_devel (dir)
	Scripts for setting up a sipXecs development environment on
	an i386 32-bit Fedora 8 installation. See: 
        http://wiki.sipfoundry.org/display/xecsdev/Express+Development+Environment+Setup

doggerel
	poems, balladry, rhymes, verse.  Makes the Vogons sound good!
