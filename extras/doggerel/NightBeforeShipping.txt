'Twas the Night before shipping
and throughout the source,
no one was coding, 'cept Ranga of course!

The buildbot was compiling its objects with care.
Tracking symbols and binaries with flair.
But just on a rather silly dare
Ranga committed once more.

The buildbot began to chug once again
Through symbol and source file with legerdemain,
Then suddenly it croaked and ground to a halt
Was Damian or Woof this time at fault?
Or perhaps this time it was Scott?
 
'twas Scott allright in his usual style.
It seems he had thrown in in a rather large pile
Of un-adulterated Perl.

And buildbot he started to do his thing again
By this time, he had started to feel the pain
Of many a re-compile

What riches this time would the big machine bring
While it ground on and did do it its thing.
Would it make us all into persons of wealth 
Or merely ruin our mental health?



--Woof!
