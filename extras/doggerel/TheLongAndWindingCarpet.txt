The long and winding carpet,
Leads me to your door.
Appears in my mailbox
I've seen that mail before.

I thought that I had joined long ago
But they keep coming back
Still they lead me back 
Lead me to your door!

Many times they reappear
And many times I cried
But there again do they  come
Oh no its time to hide.

How many times aboard to I need to climb
Before I break my back?
Still they find do me here
And bore me to a tear.
