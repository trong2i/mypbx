So Kraken it was, that dangerous monster
We tried to sink him right in the water
But laugh did he, that horrible beast!
For sinking, for him, was merely a treat.

"Its fresh air I hate", said he with a grin
You dont sink a sea monster - you air him, you see
"I'll take all your passwords, I'll take them" said he
"For after all, you gave them to me!"
