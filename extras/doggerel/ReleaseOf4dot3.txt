Apologies to Robert Service

There are strange things done
during midnight fun
by those who toil with codes.
And the IRC logs, and even some blogs
mention features and bugs on their nodes.

The project's late nights
have seen some delights,
but the strangest they ever did see,
was the night of the scrum
and the realization
of the release of 4 dot 3.

Now 4 dot 3 was origin-ally
just for developer's--after all.
But market gurus, thought
"What the who?", 
(they didn't get that at all!)
"We can ship twice as much!",
they thought in a rush,
"We can double our output, and then",
"we can ship 4 dot 4, without too much more!"
And then the real madness began.

For 4 dot 3, 'twas never to be,
for once they set out on this road,
they began to realize,
(to no one's surprise,)
That the numbers could be overrode!

"'5 oh' sounds much better", 
they said to each other
"Or perhaps, 'Two Thousand and Ten'"
"Bigger!", they cried, so then 'twas decide--
"Release Infinity dot 10!"

--Woof!
