An Ode to Code

One late night session
of coding obsession,
awaiting the caffeine to kick in.

I came across code
that was really quite old
Was from before the source tracking begins!

The code though was bold
was a sight to behold!
It was elegant, and simple within.

But the comments were cryptic.
They drove me apocalyptic!
So I tried to discover the source.

Then I started to grin
with a little chagrin
'Twas me that had wrote them, of course!

--Woof!
