OVERVIEW - (Y)et (A)nother (R)est (D)aemon
==========================================

sipXyard or simply YARD is an implementation of a RESTful persistence store,
process and configuration manager.  It is brought about by a need for external
applications to manage a remote Linux system using standard HTTP request in a 
secure fashion.  LevelDB is used as the Key-Value store to persist individual 
REST records.  The keys will be retrieved as a structured JSON document. 

DEPENDENCIES - Library Dependencies
============

sipXcommserverLib   : sipXecs Communications Server Library
LevelDB             : Key Value Store support
POCO C++            : HTTP Support


INSTALLING - How To Install YARD on CentOS 6
==========================================

1.  Copy the latest repo file for sipXecs into /etc/yum.repos.d from 
http://download.sipfoundry.org or you can directly create a new file and type
the following:

[sipXecs]
name=sipXecs software for CentOS $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://download.sipfoundry.org/pub/14.10-unstable/CentOS_$releasever/$basearch
gpgcheck=0

2.  Install sipXyard

    #~ sudo yum install sipxyard

NOTE: Installing sipXyard will also install the required dependencies



RUNNING - How To Run YARD
=========================

YARD is installed as /usr/bin/sipxyard.  You can run yard as a console 
application or as a Linux daemon by specifying a PID file when you run YARD.
The following parameters can be specified in the command line.

Parameters:

  --host arg               The IP Address where the HTTP Server will listen for
                           connections.
  --port arg               The port where the HTTP Server will listen for 
                           connections.
  --secure-host arg        The IP Address where the HTTP Server will listen for
                           TLS connections.
  --secure-port arg        The port where the HTTP Server will listen for TLS 
                           connections.
  --data-directory arg     The directory where the HTTP Server will store data.
  --auth-user arg          User for Basic/Digest authentication.
  --auth-password arg      Password for Basic/Digest authentication.
  --private-key-file arg   Contains the path to the private key file used for 
                           encryption
  --certificate-file arg   Contains the path to the certificate file (in PEM 
                           format)
  --ca-location arg        Contains the path to the file or directory 
                           containing the CA/root certificates.
  --pass-phrase arg        Pass phrase if the private key is protected by a 
                           password.
  --verify-client-certs    The server sends a client certificate request to the
                           client and verify it.
  --secure-transport-only  Set this flag if only TLS transport (https) will be 
                           allowed.
  -h [ --help ]            : Display help information.
  -v [ --version ]         : Display version information.
  -P [ --pid-file ] arg    : PID file when running as daemon.
  -L [ --log-file ] arg    : Specify the application log file.
  -l [ --log-level ] arg   : Specify the application log priority level.Valid 
                           level is between 0-7.  0 (EMERG) 1 (ALERT) 2 (CRIT) 
                           3 (ERR) 4 (WARNING) 5 (NOTICE) 6 (INFO) 7 (DEBUG)
  -C [ --config-file ] arg : Optional configuration file.


For testing purposes, you can run /usr/bin/sipxyard without any argument.  It 
will start listening on the default port 8020 and will store LeveLDB data in the
current working directory.  In production, it is advisable for you to use TLS
on top of BASIC authentication.

If you intend to use YARD to manage system processes, make sure you run it with
enough privilege to access and control them.  This also applies, if you need to
set the data directory to system folders such as /etc/ or /var.


PERSISTENCE - Using YARD To Store Data
======================================

YARD supports CRUD operations using standard HTTP Methods.

PUT:    (C)reate records in the persistence store
GET:    (R)ead records from the persistence store
POST:   (U)pdate records from the persistence store
DELETE: (D)elete records from the persistence store

NOTE:  PUT/POST can be used interchangeably since YARD does not distinguish
between insert and update operations.  YARD always performs UPSERT.  If the 
record does not exists, it is inserted.  Otherwise, it is updated.

DOCUMENT ROOT - Document Path URI
=================================

The persistence store is accessed using /root prefix.  For example, if you want
to write to document 'foo', the URI for this document is 
http://yard:8020/root/foo.

Each document created will have a corresponding LevelDB folder created where 
the active data-directory is pointed to.  This folder will contain various files
that LevelDB needs for the Key-Value store operations.  It is advisable that
each group of related data goes to their corresponding document instead of 
dumping a bunch of unrelated data in one big document.  Having multiple document
store will make your queries faster.

NOTE:  There is no special operation required to create documents in YARD.  As
records are stored, the document is automatically created after the first 
attempt to POST or PUT a new record.


CREATING RECORDS - Values and Structures
========================================

To persist records in YARD all you need to do is to submit a POST or a PUT 
request with "value" as either a URI or a FORM parameter.  The value parameter
will hold the data you want to store.  For example, if you want store data
to a key "mykey" in document foo, the URI should look like 
http://yard:8020/root/foo/mykey?value=somevalue. There is a good REST extension
for Google Chrome called Postman or you may opt to use curl command line.  Curl
command line would look like this:

    #~ curl --data "value=somevalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mykey

You may also store nested structures instead of individual values. Example

    #~ curl --data "value=somevalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val1
    #~ curl --data "value=somevalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val2

will store 'val1' and 'val2' as members of the structure 'mystruct'.  There
is no limit in how deep you want to nest structures.  You  can for example add a 
structure within 'mystruct'.  So on and so forth.  Example:

    #~ curl --data "value=myvalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val3/sub1
    #~ curl --data "value=myvalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val3/sub2

The above example will store a substructure named 'val3' inside 'mystruct' and 
with members 'sub1' and 'sub2'

CAVEAT:  When performing updates, you can only update records if you are 
storing the same object type as the one already stored in the database. For 
example /root/foo/mykey is a "Value" object.  You cannot update it with a new
object containing a structure. For example:  

    #~ curl --data "value=myvalue" http://yard:8020/root/foo/mykey/val1

will be rejected.  This is also true if you attempt to replace a structure with
a value object.

READING RECORDS - Query Operations using GET
============================================

Once you have stored values in YARD, you can retrieve them by referencing them 
using thir path in the Document.  You can for example get all records from a 
document by using the document path /root/foo will result to a JSON document
representing all records in document foo.

{
    foo: {
    mykey: "somevalue"
    mystruct: {
        val1: "somevalue"
        val2: "somevalue"
        val3: {
            sub1: "myvalue"
            sub2: "myvalue"
            }
        }
    }
}

You can get specific records by appending the key of the record in the path.  
If you want to get the value of val3, for example, you should issue a GET 
request with path http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val3 and it would result 
to:

{
    val3: {
        sub1: "myvalue"
        sub2: "myvalue"
    }
}

You can narrow down up to the actual value of each element.  'sub2' value
can be retrieved by the path URI http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val3/sub2 
and you should get the actual value as a result.

{
    sub2: "myvalue"
}

If a record you are trying to retrieve does not exists, YARD will cordially 
respond back with a 404.

DELETING Records - DELETE Operation
===================================

DELETE and GET operations have the same semantics.  You can delete certain 
records or even all records if you specify the path.  For example:

    #~ curl -X DELETE http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct/val3/sub2

will delete the element 'sub2' from the structure 'val'.  

    #~ curl -X DELETE http://yard:8020/root/foo/mystruct

will delete mystruct and all the elements below it and

    #~ curl -X DELETE http://yard:8020/root/foo

will delete all records from document 'foo'

Unlike GET, YARD will not respond with a 404 if the record that is being DELETEd
is not present.  A 200 OK will be sent back by YARD even if the record does not
exists.


CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT - Using YARD To Generate Config Files
==============================================================

You  can use YARD as a remote configuration manager for your Linux applications
that support the INI configuration format.  The URI path /root/system-config
has a special meaning in YARD where all structures stored in this document
can be exported as an INI file in local file system of the server hosting the 
YARD instance.  Take the following curl commands as an example:

    #~ curl --data "value=val1" http://yard:8020/root/system-config/myapp/param1
    #~ curl --data "value=val2" http://yard:8020/root/system-config/myapp/param2
    #~ curl --data "value=val3" http://yard:8020/root/system-config/myapp/param3

The above commands insert three parameters in the structure myapp.

To export these paramaters into the file system in INI format, you can issue
the command

    #~ curl --data "path=/etc/myapp/myapp.ini" \
        http://yard:8020/api/system-config/myapp/replicate

Take note of the prefix in the above command.  Instead of '/root/system-config',
we changed it to '/api/system-config'.  This tells YARD that the URI is invoking
an API command as opposed to a persistent store command.  You will notice that 
we have the API call replicate as a suffix to structure 'myapp'.  And finally,
the 'path' parameter value is where you want the values stored.  This will 
result to an INI file with content below

/etc/myapp/myapp.ini

param1 = val1
param2 = val2
param3 = val3

You may also insert structures within the configuration document.  Structure
elements will be represented using dot notation.  Take the curl command below
as an example

    #~ curl --data "value=val1" \
        http://yard:8020/root/system-config/myapp/param4/elem1

This will result to an INI entry below

param4.elem1 = val1


PROCESS MANAGEMENT - Managing And Monitoring Server Applications
================================================================

1.  You can monitor the status and memory consumption of a process using the
/api/proc/${process}/status URI.  ${process} is a placeholder of the executable
filename (case-sensitive) you want to check.  This API call will return the 
Process ID and Physical memory consumption of the process as a JSON structure.
Below is an example of getting the status of gedit using the URI 
/api/proc/gedit/status:

{"gedit":[{"PID": "8062","RES": "5668 kB"}]}

Note:  If there are more than one instance of the process running, the 
status API call will return an array.

2.  You can kill a running process using /api/proc/${process}/kill API call.  
You need to specify the process ID as a parameter.  The curl command below will
kill the gedit instance above.

    #~ curl --data "pid=8062" http://yard:8020/api/proc/gedit/kill

3.  Lastly, you will be able to restart system service using
/api/proc/${initscript}/restart API call where ${initscript} is the name of the
/etc/init.d script for the system service.  For example, the curl command below
will restart iptables

#~ curl http://yard:8020/api/proc/iptables/restart
